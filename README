Example applications using AD FS 2.0 (Active Directory Federation Services)

1. MVC3_PassiveRedirectLogin

Demonstrates usage of ADFS as identity provider through passive redirect. The term "passive" comes from the fact thatthe application doesn't have to do anything, but the authentication is handled by the Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) and AD FS. 

Try out the example by replacing in web.config all instances of ADFSSERVER with your own AD FS 2.0 server address.
